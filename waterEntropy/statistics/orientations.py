    This equation is modified from the previous theory of water molecule
    orientational entropy, where hydrogen bonding is accounted for by reducing
    the number of available neighbours.
    Here, the coordination shell neighbours available to hydrogen bond with
    are reduced to $Nc_eff$. The reduction in available HBing neighbours is
    calculated from statistics gathered from simulation trajectories, where
    neighbour types that are donated to or accepted from are counted.

    Nc_eff = sum_i((ppD_i * ppA_i) * N_i / 0.25)

    where $ppD_i$ is the probability to donate to a given neighbour type i
    compared to accepting from the same neighbour type. $ppA_i$ is the
    equivalent probability for accepting from neighbour type i.

    $pbias_ave$ is the average bias in accepting from and donating to
    a given neighbour type i. If it is equally likely to donate to and
    accept from all neighbour types, then $pbias_ave=0.25$, but if there is
    any bias in preferentially donating to, accepting from or not HBing to a
    neighbour at all, then $pbias_ave < 0.25$.

    $pbias_ave$ = sum_i(ppD_i * ppA_i) / Nc

    of the central molecule by accounting for the HBing observed in a
