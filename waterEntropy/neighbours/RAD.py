r"""
These functions calculate coordination shells using RAD the relative
angular distance, as defined first in DOI:10.1063/1.4961439
where united atoms (heavy atom + bonded Hydrogens) are defined as neighbours if
they fulfil the following condition:

.. math::
    \\Bigg(\frac{1}{r_{ij}}\\Bigg)^2>\\Bigg(\frac{1}{r_{ik}}\\Bigg)^2 \\cos \theta_{jik}

For a given particle i, neighbour j is in its coordination shell if k is not
blocking particle j. In this implementation of RAD, we enforce symmetry, whereby
neighbouring particles must be in each others coordination shells.
